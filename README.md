# Machine-Learning
# Supervised Learning Classification Project

This project implements a supervised learning classification workflow, including:

1. Loading and exploring train/test datasets
2. Performing EDA with statistics and visualizations
3. Applying feature engineering techniques
4. Training and comparing at least 2 learning algorithms
5. Conducting hyperparameter tuning
6. Selecting the best model using 5-fold cross-validation and grid search
7. Final model training on full training set
8. Evaluation on test set

The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model selection, and performance evaluation techniques for a classification task.
